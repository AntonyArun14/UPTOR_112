Process of representing the data in the graph or flow chart.
In python visualization can be achieved by four different libraries

1. matplotlib
2. seaborn
3. plotly
4. dash

Focus will be on matplotlib and seaborn

Installation:

pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn

External Tool for Visualization :PowerBI and Tableau.
Focus: PowerBI

Visualization:

1. matplotlib can works on its own
2. seaborn is built on to of matplotlib
so when we use seaborn we need to use both seaborn and matplotlib.

Visualization Types:

1. Uni-Variate --> Only with one input
2. Bi-Variate --> with two input (x and y)

Dimension: we will be focussing on only two dimensional images.

Visualization:

1. number VS number (x numeric and y numeric )
2. number VS category (x category and y numeric )
3. number only
