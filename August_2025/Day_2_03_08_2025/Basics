Data Science - It is the process of finding a beautiful, informative
and pattern about the data.

Reason: Either for the direct projection or future prediction

DataScience is not a programming language. It is just a mechanism.

Programming Language:

Programming language is the language to communicate with our system.

1. JAVA
2. C
3. C++
4. C#
5. Python (Most Used)

Data :
1. Structured Data - Focus in our Course
  1.1 Excel 1.2 CSV 1.3 DataBase

2. Un-Structured Data - Focussed
  2.1 Video 2.2 Audio 2.3 Image

3. Semi-Structured Data - Un-Focussed
  3.1 Chat 3.2 text file

Data Science is process of finding insights, patterns, flows of the data
and that can be done by two division.

Data Science , Python and Machine Learning Concept

Machine Learning: It is the process of manipulating data and processing
for the structured elements like CSV file, Excel and DataBase.

It is algorithm to process the structured data.

----------------------------------------------------------

Data Science =

Take or read the data ---> CSV EXCEL DB
Pre processing        ---> ETL (Extract Transform Load)
Model                 ---> Use it for prediction
Visualization          ---> Know your data with this visualization

Tools:

Python , machine learning, powerBI


Data Engineering = Storage, Retention,

Tools:
Data Lake , Hadoop

Data Analysis or Analytics:

Take or read the data ----> CSV, Excel, or any other source(DB)
Pre-Process and Visualize ---> ETL

Tools:
PowerBI, Tableau, Excel (Important), DB, PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

2. Model Selection and Prediction

Model - Inbuilt algorithm to do certain activity.

2.1 Machine Learning:
    2.1.1 Supervised Learning
          Note: Knowing what we going to predict the target is called supervised

         Classification and Regression

         Linear Regression
         Logistic Regression
         DecisionTree Classifier, DecisionTree Regressor
         SVM Classifier, SVM Regressor
         KNN Classifier, KNN Regressor
         RandomForest Classifier, RandomForest Regressor
         NaiveBayes Classifier, NaiveBayes Regressor


    2.1.1 Un-Supervised Learning
          Note: Just doing the process without knowing the target

          Clustering:
          K-Means Clustering
          Hierarchical Clustering
               TopDown (Agglomerative Clustering)
               BottomUp (Divisive Clustering)
          PCA
          t-SNA
          DBSCAN

    2.1.2 Semi-Supervised Learning
