GITHUB Registration:

https://github.com/login

Basic: it is similar to google drive to store and retrieve files

Register:

1. either do it manually
2. or do with your google SSO (Single Sign On)

GITHUB Usage:

1. I have Project "LMES_112_Saturday_Sunday". I want share this project
with everyone without physical sharing.

2. So i use should something like "repository"(Common Storage and Sharing)
    2.1 So we will consider "GITHUB" as common repo for the same.

Now imagine this situation, i want to do some changes to the files which i had it in my
repo

Mohan    - already has his parent folder (Main Branch)
--------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

Karthika - to add KNN with regression model
divya    - to add SVM with regression
ashok    - to add visualization to the existing code
arun     - to add KNN with Classification
raja     - to add SVM with classification

Step 1: (Physical storage and MergeR)
Each one of the above should first clone my repo or download the parent folder

Step 2:
Each one hav to do the changes and update to me in mail.

Day 1 Karthika submits the files so am adding her file with my main file

        Mohan + Karthika's File (Main)

Day 2 ashok submits the files so am adding his file with the main file

       Mohan + Karthika's + ashok's file (Main)

Day 3 raja submits the files so am adding his file with the main file

       Mohan + Karthika's + ashok's + raja's File

Conflicts: Now Raja has made some changes in "hello.py" where ashok also has his changes

now to overcome all this problem of file and folders , we should go for file or folder or project
versioning.

So GITHUB will act as project versioning Tool.

Following is via github:

Basic Step: Each one of the above should first clone my repo or download the parent folder

Day 1 Karthika submits the files so am adding her file with my main file

        Mohan + Karthika's File

     Step 1: She have to do the following

         1.1 git add <file_name>
               git add knn_regression.py
         1.2 git commit -m "to add knn regression model into main"
         1.3 git push origin https://github.com/mohansivaraman7/UPTOR_112.git

         Now mohan can able to see the new changes made by karthika on her branch.

         main ---> karthika

         1.4 create a PR (Pull Request)
         1.5 once PR is created she have to intimate me,

         after i ll go and cross verify her changes, if all looks fine then i ll merge it.





Day 2 ashok submits the files so am adding his file with the main file


         1.1 git add <file_name>
               git add SVM_regression.py
         1.2 git commit -m "to add SVM regression model into main"
         1.3 git push origin https://github.com/mohansivaraman7/UPTOR_112.git

         Now mohan can able to see the new changes made by karthika on her branch.

         main ---> ashok's branch

         1.4 create a PR (Pull Request)
         Now ashok will get some message saying his branch is outdated.

         Since ashok's main is not update. he have to pycharm and run the following command

         1.4.1   git pull

         after that execute the PR

         1.4.2 create a PR (now it will updated_

         1.5 once PR is created she have to intimate me,

         after i ll go and cross verify her changes, if all looks fine then i ll merge it.

Day 3 raja submits the files so am adding his file with the main file

       Mohan + Karthika's + ashok's + raja's File
