1. Machine Learning :

   It is kind of algorithm that takes the data, finds the
   pattern, insightful, details about the data
   and used for either "Prediction" or "analysis"

2. How to achieve this ?
   Process of doing thing on machine learning is done
   via libraries and many software language.

   Python , scikit-learn (best used combination)

3. What is data science?

   Process of finding insights, details, forecast , prediction
   about the data (structure or unstructured) via a algorithm and model
   is called data science.

   Data Science can be achieved using either "Machine Learning"
   or "Deep Learning"

4. what is the library which we can use for file reading??

import csv
import pandas

Note: pandas is widely used considering its easy reading option

5. what are all the different file that can be read using pandas.

csv, excel, json....

6. Is is necessary to create virtual environment ??

YEs !!!

Virtual environment can be created using following two mechanism.

1. through pycharm
2. through command line prompt (home assignment)

What is StandardScalar and MinMaxScaler.

Both of this is called Feature Scaling.
Feature ---> input or x data or independent data
Scaling ---> Converting one form of numbers into another form of numbers

This Feature Scaling can be achieved by two libraries.

1. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalar
2. from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

StandardScaler ---> Returns the output in Normal Distribution
MinMaxScalar ---> Returns the output in Uniform Distribution

StandardScalar value will be between -1 to 1
MinMaxScalar value will be between 0 to 1

When to use these feature scaling?

When we have different unit of measurement for different column, then model may not
perform well as expected. So we will be using this to ensure all the columns stay in the
accepted distribution.

Where it is used?

Feature scaling is used or can be used anywhere but specifically it should be used in
"distance based algorithm"

When StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

StandardScalar: (KNN, SVM, KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering)
In all the distance based algorithms

MinMaxScaler:
In all the neural network based (deep learning)

Note: Algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression
and Logistic Regression may not need scaling.
